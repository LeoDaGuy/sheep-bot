You emit more stupid in one second than our entire galaxy emits in a year. Quasar stupid. Your writing has to be a troll. Nothing in our universe can really be this stupid. Perhaps this is some primordial fragment from the original big bang of stupid. Some pure essence of a stupid so uncontaminated by anything else as to be beyond the laws of physics that we know. I'm sorry. I can't go on. This is an epiphany of stupid for me. After this, you may not hear from me again for a while.

True, these are rudimentary skills that many of us "normal" people take for granted that everyone has an easy time of mastering.

The insult is in the mirror.", "You absolute waste of space and air. You uneducated, ignorant, idiotic dumb swine, you‚Äôre an absolute embarrassment to humanity and all life as a whole. The magnitude of your failure just now is so indescribably massive that one hundred years into the future your name will be used as moniker of evil for heretics. Even if all of humanity put together their collective intelligence there is no conceivable way they could have thought up a way to frick up on the unimaginable scale you just did. When Jesus died for our sins, he must not have seen the sacrilegious act we just witnessed you performing, because if he did he would have forsaken humanity long ago so that your birth may have never become reality. After you die, your skeleton will be displayed in a museum after being scientifically researched so that all future generations may learn not to generate your bone structure, because every tiny detail anyone may have in common with you degrades them to a useless piece of trash and a burden to society. No wonder your father questioned whether or not your were truly his son, for you‚Äôd have to not be a waste of carbon matter for anyone to love you like a family member. Your birth made it so that mankind is worse of in every way you can possibly imagine, and you have made it so that society can never really recover into a state of organization. Everything has forever fallen into a bewildering chaos, through which unrecognizable core, you can only find misfortune. I would say the apocalypse is upon us but this is merely the closest word humans have for the sheer scale of horror that is now reality. You have forever condemned everyone you love and know into an eternal state of suffering, worse than any human concept of hell.", "You are an idiotic, shiteating, dumbass ape and no one has ever loved you. Rhodes Island would have been better off if you‚Äôd never joined us. You are a lying, backstabbing, cowardly useless piece of shit and I hate you with every single part of my being. Even this worlds finest writers and poets from throughout the ages could never hope to accurately describe the scale on which you just fricked up, and how incredibly idiotic you are. Anyone that believes in any religion out there should now realize that they have been wrong this entire time, for if divine beings were real, they would never have allowed a being such as you to stain the earth and this universe. In the future there will be horror stories made about you, with the scariest part of them being that the reader has to realize that such an indescribable monster actually exists, and that the horrific events from the movie have actually taken place in the same world that they live in right now. You are the absolute embodiment of everything that has ever been wrong on this earth, yet you manage to make it so that that is only a small part of the evil that is your being. Never in the history of mankind has there been anyone that could have predicted such an eldrich abomination, but here you are. It‚Äôs hard to believe that I am seeing such an incredible failure with my own eyes, but here I am, so unfortunately I cannot deny your existence. Even if I did my very best, my vocabulary is not able to describe the sheer magnitude of the idiotic mistake that is you. Even if time travel some day will be invented, there still would not be a single soul willing to go back in time to before this moment to fix history, because having to witness such incredible horrors if they failed would have to many mental and physical drawbacks that not even the bravest soul in history would be willing to risk it.", "I cannot imagine the pure dread your mother must have felt when she had to carry a baby for nine months and then giving birth to such a wretched monster as you. Not a single word of the incoherent, illogical rambling you may be wanting to do to defend yourself or apologize would ever be able to make up for what you just did. The countries of the world would have wanted to make laws preventing such a terrible event like this from ever happening again, but sadly this is not possible since your horrific actions just now have shattered every form of order this world once had, making concepts such as laws irrelevant. Right from the moment I first set my eyes on you I knew you were an absolute abomination of everything that is wrong with humanity. I was hoping I would have been able to prevent your evil from being released upon this world by tagging along and keeping my eye on you, but it is clear to me now that not even the greatest efforts would have been able to prevent a terrible event in this scale from occurring. You are the worst human being, or even just being in general, that I have ever had the misfortune of witnessing. Events like the infected plague apparently only happened with the goal of teaching humanity to survive such a horrible event as the one you just created, but not even mankind‚Äôs greatest trials were able to even slightly prepare anyone for the insufferable evil you have just created. If you ever had them, your children would be preemptively killed to protect this universe from the possibility of anyone in your bloodline being even half as bad as you are, except you will never be able to have children, because not a single human being will ever want to come within a hundred mile radius of you and anything you have ever touched. You are a colossal disappointment not only to your parents, but to your ancestors and entire bloodline.", "The disgusting mistake that you have just made is so incredibly terrible that everyone who would ever be to hear about it would spontaneously feel an indescribable mixture of immense anger, fear and anxiety that emotionally and physically they would never truly be the same ever again. The sheer scale of your mistake, if ever to be materialized, would not only surpass the size of the world, but it would reach far beyond the edges of the known, and almost certainly the unknown universe. I could sit here and write paragraphs, nay, books describing your immense failure, yet even if I were to dedicate my life to describing the reality of what has just gone down here, and I would spend every moment of it until my heart stops beating working as hard and efficiently as possible, yet there is not even a snowballs chance in hell that I would be able to come close to transcribing the absolute shitshow you have just released upon the world. You are an irresponsible, idiotic, disgusting, unloved, horrible excuse for a living being who‚Äôs soul contains less humanity than every ginger in history combined. The absolute disgust I feel when thinking about anything that has even a slight resemblance to anything that might have to do with you and your unholy actions is so incredibly great that when I am honest about it I think that even I do not posses a consciousness great enough to comprehend my own feelings about it. When people of Columbia fought to break free from Lungmen, countless soldiers fought and lost their lives in favor of a chance at a better future for their children, they did not give their lives to have you frick the world up beyond repair to the degree that you are doing right now.", "Honestly, even when technology advances and studies on the subject become more and more accurate, I do not think humanity will ever truly be able to understand what your failure actually means for the universe. My hate for you and everything you stand for is so much deeper than the depths of Shambala that you could probably take the entire Lungmen population down there and back up around twenty million times before you would have sunk to the end of my hate, and honestly, I do not want to exaggerate, but I think that that insult was low balling it such a massive amount that all mountains in this world combined would not be able to stack up to this imprecise judgement in light of the fact that when being honest, my hate is almost certainly bottomless. There is no one in this world that has ever loved you, and especially after what you just did, no one will ever love you in the future either. There is no hope that your idiotic behavior and especially your crooked soul will ever change for the better, and in fact quite the opposite might be true. By making the mistake that you just did, you have shown me that you are so incredibly hopeless that you will only devolve into a more idiotic and wretched creature than you already are. The only possible way in which your future would be brighter than the black hole your existence currently is would exclusively be because there is absolutely no conceivable way that you would even be able to sink lower than the pathetic place your current failure has put you in.", "i don like you", "you smell bad", "you ugly", "you so fat that your health is bad", "i would eat you but you would taste bad", "you are failure", "you are biggest failure ever", "i will send you to jesus", "you sus", "i saw you vent", "if you were a potato you would be dumb potato", "i dont care", "i bet you wont do `^shear` i bet you wont", "even rick would give you up", "i will eat you", "your brain", "your life", "your existence", "watermelon is to banana as your brain is to fish", "your brain is like the bad things about peter, nonexistent (disregard this if you are peter)", "bad","dum","I hope your phone charger only works at a certain angle", "I hope you don't find the long side of your covers", "If only you were a stain in your father's underpants...", "you are a damp sock puppet", "prepare your anus", "how's your wife's boyfriend?", "you are stupid", "you are dum", "is your name chuck?", "go back to the orphanage you came from", "go back to the supermarket you were purchased from", "go back to the zoo you escaped from", "i won't bully you if you join discord.gg/obama", "even rick will desert you", "If you were any stupider we'd have to water you", "you STINK", "When God put teeth in your mouth, he ruined a perfectly good arsehole.", "If you were any less intelligent I'd have to water you twice a week.", "Your family tree doesn't branch much, does it?", "You have single handedly turned your family tree into a family wreath", "You're like the white crayon, unused, unliked, and without a purpose.", "I hope you outlive your kids.", "If I wanted to kill myself I'd climb your ego and jump to your IQ.", "I refuse to enter a battle of wits with an unarmed man", "May your armpits be infested with the fleas of a thousand camels.", "I fart in your general direction", "ur more dum than chack","I will not bully, I am a nice sentient entity", "if you were lucas you would be smart but rn you arent", "bollocks", "PETER IS GOD, YOU ARENT", "You're an idiot.

If God ever decides to give the planet an enema you'd better run like the wind because anywhere you stand is a suitable place for The Insertion. There is no animal so disgusting, so vile that it deserves comparison to you, for even the lowest, dirtiest, most parasitic member of the animal kingdom fills an ecological niche. You fill no niche. To call you a parasite would be injurious and defamatory to the thousands of honest parasitic species. You are worse than vermin, for vermin do not pretend to be what it is not. You are truly human garbage. You are a fraudulent, lying, predatory charlatan. You are of less worth than a burnt-out light bulb.

When participating in intense periods of gaming, the human hand has a tendency to get sweaty. The sweat causes the hand to become slick, and it b becomes more difficult to retain a grip on the gamers gaming mouse, thus making it more difficult to perform well in intense gaming moments. By touching grass with the gamers hand, the grass will impart a layer of particulate onto the gamers hand, the particulate can be made of a variety of dusts, dirts and other natural matter. This particulate will then act in a similar form to climbers chalk, absorbing the sweat and drying out the gamers hand. With dry hands, the gamer can now perform to their maximum when gaming. This is why when an enemy or teammate tells you to touch grass, they are simply trying to assist you in performing better.")

By 2025 everyone will be forced to kick dance to ra ra rasputin on a daily basis and anyone who refuses is shot. Everything and I mean E V E R Y T H I N G will be painted a deep red, from streets, to sidewalks, to houses, to plantlife, to wildlife, to clothes, to people. No other color exists, and soon people's eyesight will evolve to only detect red shades of color, and rgb will soon be known as rrr. And if everything goes exactly according to plan, by the 2032, all water on earth will have been completely replaced by pure vodka, and humans will have evolved to drink only vodka and any other liquid that was once edible will be toxic to the human body. CrazyRussianHacker will be the only youtuber people are allowed to watch, and is the only youtuber still successful on the platform. Now to just hand this in to my history teacher and to just hand this in to my history teacher and soon everything will come together. And by that I mean my life will finally fall apart.")

There's something so attractive about drones, their huge, swooping curves, the elegant and long wings, which allow for such efficient, stable flight characteristics. Perhaps it's the swiftness and precision of a strike aircraft, it's unique ability to hit, explode, and kill exactly what the pilot intended, and yet, so naughtily, not kill a single bad guy. Someday l'd like to have an unmanned military aircraft of my own. However, know that it's hard to find military aircraft that will share feeling like I do. I guess the love felt between man and drone is too far and few between for me to find a partner who will truly satisfy me. So this must be life for me as a dronesexual, never to feel the cold, metal touch of a beautiful, autonomous, military aircraft.")

I sat at their table, and right as I sat down, I noticed that one of the kids (who happened to be black) was sitting above a vent. I yelled \"Black is sus! He's on top of a vent!!\" Everyone at the table looked up at me, but no one laughed (they probably didn't get the reference).\n\nI decided that I would try to get them to be familiar with it, so I asked \"Do to guys wanna play some Among Us???\" They were all dead silent (honestly they just didn't know how fun of a game it was). I slapped the middle of our table (to mimick the \"emergency meeting\" feature in Among Us), and I screamed \"EMERGENCY MEETING!!!\" Again, none of them laughed. One of them looked at me and said \"Can you please sit somewhere else?\" At this point, I realized that I had to make them laugh quickly, or I would blow my chance with them.\n\nI made the widest grin I could possibly make (Trying to mimick the \"When the imposter is sus\" meme) and I said \"When the impoter is sus\". I then tried to make a face that resembled the \"Flushed\" emoji (as part of the meme). However, I don't think any of them understood the reference.\n\nI then pulled up the among us theme song on Youtube and played it on full blast. At this point, everyone at my table was asking for me to leave, and their friend came back, who regularly sat in the chair I was sitting in. I went back to sit with my friends from band.\n\nHowever, I will forever remember the time I trolled ALL of the popular kids in my grade.")

The winner gets to go another round. I have found that, in general, the brown and red M&Ms are tougher, and the newer blue ones are genetically inferior. I have hypothesized that the blue M&Ms as a race cannot survive long in the intense theater of competition that is the modern candy and snack-food world. Occasionally I will get a mutation, a candy that is misshapen, or pointier, or flatter than the rest. Almost invariably this proves to be a weakness, but on very rare occasions it gives the candy extra strength. In this way, the species continues to adapt to its environment. When I reach the end of the pack, I am left with one M&M, the strongest of the herd. Since it would make no sense to eat this one as well, I pack it neatly in an envelope and send it to M&M Mars, A Division of Mars, Inc., Hackettstown, NJ 17840-1503 U.S.A., along with a 3√ó5 card reading, ‚ÄúPlease use this M&M for breeding purposes.‚Äù This week they wrote back to thank me, and sent me a coupon for a free 1/2 pound bag of plain M&Ms. I consider this ‚Äúgrant money.‚Äù I have set aside the weekend for a grand tournament.
