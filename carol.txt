You better give up
On insomnia this year
You haven’t a chance
With Discord bots here
Sheep bot’s coming to UTP

He tracks down your chats
And when they were sent
If it’s past 10 PM
You get scronched with resent
Sheep bot’s coming to UTP

He knows when you’re not sheeping
He knows when you’re awake
He knows when you’re playing Clash Royale
(okay, that part’s probably fake)

You better tuck in
Earlier this year
You can’t stay up 
Till 1 AM here
Sheep bot’s coming to UTP 

There’s only one way
To save your sanity
You crack the Sheep bot code
And gain immunity
Sheep bot’s coming to UTP
Sheep bot’s coming to UTP 
Sheep bot’s coming to UTP
